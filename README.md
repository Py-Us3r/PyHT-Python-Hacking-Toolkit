> This module provides a graphical interface to manage the MAC address of network interfaces, allowing you to:

- Check the current MAC address of a selected interface.
- Change the MAC address to a new user-specified value.
- Restore the original MAC address at any time.

> This module allows you to perform ARP Poisoning attacks through a graphical interface, making it easier to test and demonstrate man-in-the-middle (MITM) scenarios in controlled environments.

## ARP Flooding
