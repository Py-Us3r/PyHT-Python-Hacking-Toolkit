> This module scans the local network using ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to identify connected devices. It retrieves their IP address, MAC address, and manufacturer information via an external API.

## MAC Changer

> This module provides a graphical interface to manage the MAC address of network interfaces, allowing you to:

- Check the current MAC address of a selected interface.
- Change the MAC address to a new user-specified value.
- Restore the original MAC address at any time.

## ARP Spoofing / Poisoning

> This module allows you to perform ARP Poisoning attacks through a graphical interface, making it easier to test and demonstrate man-in-the-middle (MITM) scenarios in controlled environments.

## ARP Flooding

> This module allows you to perform ARP flooding attacks through a graphical interface, making it easier to test and demonstrate network disruption and denial-of-service scenarios in controlled environments.It launch of continuous ARP flood packets to overwhelm them, with real-time feedback and control to start or stop the attack safely.

## Sniffer

> This module provides a graphical packet sniffer that allows you to monitor and analyze network traffic in real time. Designed for use in authorized environments, it supports three distinct sniffing modes:

üîç Modes:

- Normal Sniffing: Captures and displays a live summary of all network packets on the selected interface.

- DNS Sniffing: Filters and displays only DNS queries (UDP port 53), allowing users to see domain requests made by the system. Common domains like Google or Bing are ignored for clarity.

- HTTP Sniffing: Captures HTTP requests, shows visited URLs, and scans raw packet data for potential credential keywords such as pass, login, or user.
